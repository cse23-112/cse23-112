            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p>Queen Charlotte, portrayed in "Bridgerton" as a powerful and influential figure during the Regency era, represents a significant departure
           <br>from historical norms as she is depicted as a Black woman, challenging traditional narratives and adding diversity to the storyline. Her
           <br>character's impact extends beyond the royal court, influencing London's social and political circles and driving key plot developments.
           <br>Through her relationships with characters like Lady Danbury and the Duke of Hastings, Queen Charlotte embodies themes of race, identity, and 
           <br>privilege, sparking important discussions about representation and historical accuracy. This portrayal not only adds depth to the series but 
           <br>also reflects broader cultural shifts in storytelling and the exploration of contemporary social themes in historical contexts.</p>
